            "description": "<h4>Introduction</h4>In spite of the increasing prevalence of polycystic ovary syndrome, there are restricted studies about different features of PCOS. In this study, we evaluate serum prolactin levels in PCOS patients and compare clinical features and hormone levels between patients with hyperprolactinemia and normal levels of prolactin.<h4>Methods</h4>Serum prolactin level in 330 PCOS patients were evaluated. If the prolactin levels were normal (equal to or less than 25 ng/ml) the patient was considered normal. If the prolactin levels were >25 ng/ml, then the level was measured by Polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation method to detect macroprolactinemia. Furthermore, brain MRI was done in case of hyperprolactinemia to discover pituitary adenoma.<h4>Results</h4>Among 330 patients with PCOS, 208 (63.4%) had normal prolactin levels and 122 (37%) patients had hyperprolactinemia. Among hyperprolactinemic patients, 72 (59%) had normal prolactin levels after PEG precipitation and 33 (27%) patients had pituitary adenoma in their brain MRI and 17 (13%) patients were considered as idiopathic hyperprolactinemia with normal MRI. Further, higher levels of LH and LH/FSH ratio and lower estradiol levels were observed in patients with normal prolactin levels. Also, menstrual disorders were more prevalent among patients with pituitary adenoma.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Investigating increased level of prolactin in PCOS patients is recommended to detect the causes of hyperprolactinemia, especially macroprolactinemia."

            "description": "<h4>Objectives</h4>Women with potential breast and cervical cancer symptoms in South Africa (SA) usually self-present to primary health care (PHC) clinics. The aim of this study was to explore PHC provider interpretation and management of potential breast and cervical cancer signs and symptoms.<h4>Methods</h4>In-depth interviews with PHC providers incorporating vignettes were conducted between April and May 2019 in two sites in SA. Four vignettes (two breast and two cervical) were developed by the research team to capture aspects of provider symptom interpretation, reasoning, actions and challenges. The content of the vignettes was informed by a preceding community-based survey and qualitative interviews with symptomatic women. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using a thematic analysis approach.<h4>Results</h4>Twenty-four PHC providers were interviewed (12 urban, 12 rural; median age: 43 years). Four main themes relating to clinical assessment and reasoning; referral and feedback challenges; awareness of breast and cervical cancer policy guidelines and training and education needs emerged. Vignette-prompted questions relating to presenting symptoms, and possible accompanying symptoms and signs, demonstrated comprehensive proposed history taking and clinical assessment by PHC providers. Cancer was considered as a potential diagnosis by the majority of PHC providers. PHC providers also considered the possibility of infectious causes for both breast and cervical vignettes indicating they would ask questions around human immunodeficiency virus status, use of anti-retroviral therapy, and, for those with cervical symptoms, would need to rule out a sexually transmitted infection. Sexual assault was considered in assessing the cervical symptom scenarios. Providers raised issues around cumbersome booking systems and lack of feedback from referral centres. The need for provider and patient education and training to improve timely diagnosis of breast and cervical cancer was raised. Most providers were not aware of current breast or cervical cancer policy guidelines.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Clinical assessment at PHC level is complex and influenced by local health issues. Providing context-relevant training and support for PHC providers, and improving referral and feedback systems, could assist timely diagnosis of women with symptomatic breast and cervical cancer."

The aim of this study was to assess Health- Related Quality of Life (HRQoL), depression, and anxiety in Iranian women with different PCOS phenotypes.<h4>Methods</h4>The present observational, cross-sectional study was carried out on 239 PCOS women who were classified on the basis of Rotterdam criteria into four categories: A (n\u2009=\u200977), B (n\u2009=\u200938), C (n\u2009=\u200968), and D (n\u2009=\u200956). They asked to fill out three questionnaires, namely, HRQoL, SF-12, and HADS.<h4>Results</h4>No significant differences were observed between the four PCOS phenotypes for anxiety, depression and QoL, as well as HRQoL domains related to infertiliy, weight and emotional problems (P\u2009>\u20090.05). Phenotypes A and B had worse HRQoL related to hirsutism (13.98\u2009\u00b1\u20095.22, 14.13\u2009\u00b1\u20096.23, P\u2009<\u20090.001). In addition, no significant differences were observed between them for HRQoL domains. While the score of acne in phenotype D (19.60\u2009\u00b1\u20095.12, P\u2009=\u20090.003) and menstrual score in phenotype C were significantly higher comparing to the other PCOS groups (16.82\u2009\u00b1\u20093.87, P\u2009<\u20090.001).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Presenting similar psychological profiles in all phenotypes unveils the importance of pychological well-being screening, even in milder reproductive phenotypes."

This study aimed to compare the effects of lifestyle interventions on anthropometric, clinical, and biochemical parameters in adolescent girls with PCOS.<h4>Methods</h4>PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science was systematically searched to retrieve studies investigating the effects of lifestyle modifications in adolescent girls with PCOS, which were published up to December 2019. The primary outcome was Body Mass Index (BMI) and secondary outcomes were all manifestations of PCOS, including clinical, metabolic, and hormonal parameters. Random effect meta-analysis was applied for significant results. Publication bias was assessed using the Egger test.<h4>Results</h4>This study showed significant improvements in luteinizing hormone (LH) (Pooled SMD\u2009=\u2009-\u20090.1.23; 95% CI, -\u20092.44 to -\u20090.03), and Free Androgen Index (FAI) levels (Pooled SMD\u2009=\u2009-\u20090.78 95% CI, -\u20090.1.42 to -\u20090.13) in adolescent girls receiving lifestyle intervention compared to baseline. This study also revealed that diet modifications alone were associated with a significant decrease in Body Mass Index (BMI) (Pooled SMD\u2009=\u2009-\u20090.45; 95% CI, -\u20090.76 to -\u20090.13), and FG score (Pooled SMD\u2009=\u2009-\u20090.81; 95% CI, -\u20091.33 to -\u20090.28). Exercise interventions were associated with significant changes in the menstrual cycles (Pooled SMD\u2009=\u20091.16; 95% CI, 0.72 to 1.61), Ferriman-Gallwey (FG) score (Pooled SMD\u2009=\u2009-\u20090.57; 95% CI, -\u20090.99 to -\u20090.15), LH (Pooled SMD\u2009=\u2009-\u2009056; 95% CI, -\u20090.98 to -\u20090.14), Anti-M\u00fcllerian Hormone (AMH) (Pooled SMD\u2009=\u2009-\u20090.81; 95% CI, -\u20090.1.24 to -\u20090.38), and Triglyceride (TG) levels (Pooled SMD\u2009=\u2009-\u20090.32; 95% CI, -\u20090.62 to -\u20090.02).<h4>Conclusion</h4>This meta-analysis concluded lifestyle interventions, such as diet and exercise, can improve some clinical, metabolic, and hormonal parameters in adolescent girls with PCOS."

            "description": "Since the introduction of the first modern contraceptive methods, the interlink between bleeding control and contraceptive development has been a dominant and critical factor. This interplay has led to the development of safer and better contraceptive methods that are often used to control bleeding in both women with normal bleeding patterns as well as in those suffering from heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB). The success of progestin-only methods, such as hormonal IUDs or progestin dominant oral contraceptives in substantially decreasing and controlling menstrual bleeding, has led to development of multiple progestin-only protocols for the sole purpose of bleeding control. These include protocols designed to stop acute heavy bleeding as well as manage long-term bleeding. Recent publications describe a variety of protocols using high dose oral progestin pills with or without a medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) injection that demonstrate high effectiveness and good tolerability. Comparted to many other progestins, MPA is not converted in part into ethinyl estradiol and appears to have a progestin-only advantage. Norethindrone acetate (NET acetate) is converted in part to ethinyl estradiol and therefore is an especially good option for bleeding control in patients with low estrogen levels that\u00a0would benefit from estrogen replacement (such as in premenopausal women with premature menopause or hypothalamic hypogonadism)."

It was hypothesized that HT decreases ovarian reserve and AMH levels are lower in the HT group.<h4>Methods</h4>Thirty HT patients, aged between 10-18 years, and 30 healthy girls as the control group were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. The mean serum AMH levels of the groups were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test.<h4>Results</h4>There was no statistically significant difference between the patient and the control groups in terms of serum AMH levels. There was a negative correlation between serum AMH and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels and no correlation between serum AMH and anti-thyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) or anti-thyroglobulin (anti-Tg) antibody levels.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our results show that ovarian reserve of adolescent girls, as measured by serum AMH levels, is not affected by HT. Autoimmune damage to the ovaries may take time and the adolescent period may be too early to see these effects. Follow up of the patients for reproductive abnormalities and initiation of prospective studies is recommended."

In the present study, we aimed to evaluate whether the expression of NF-\u03baB p65 subunit is increased in the eutopic endometrium and/or in the adenomyosis nodule of women with adenomyosis.<h4>Methods</h4>Thirty-three women with histologically confirmed adenomyosis after laparoscopic or transabdominal hysterectomy were recruited. Women with carcinoma in situ of uterine cervix without evidence of adenomyosis or endometriosis (n=32) served as controls. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded archival tissues were sectioned and immunostained utilizing a monoclonal anti-human NF-\u03baB p65 subunit antibody, and the immunoreactivity of NF-\u03baB p65 subunit was compared between women with and without adenomyosis.<h4>Results</h4>The immunoreactivities of both the nuclear and the cytoplasmic NF-\u03baB p65 subunit were significantly increased in the stromal cells in the eutopic endometrium as well as in the adenomyosis nodule of women with adenomyosis compared with controls, respectively. The nuclear expression of NF-\u03baB p65 subunit was significantly higher in the glandular cells in the eutopic endometrium as well as the adenomyosis nodule of women with adenomyosis compared with controls, respectively.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The expression of NF-\u03baB p65 is increased in the eutopic endometrium and adenomyosis nodule of women with adenomyosis, which strongly suggest that NF-\u03baB plays a critical role in the pathogenesis and/or pathophysiology of adenomyosis."

This review aims to evaluate evidence from the literature with a\u00a0focus on the effect of biofeedback on pain reduction, overall symptom relief, physiological parameters and quality of life.<h4>Methods</h4>A\u00a0systematic literature search was conducted using the databases PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library and PEDro from inception to July 2020. Data were tabulated and a\u00a0narrative synthesis was carried out, since data heterogeneity did not allow a\u00a0meta-analysis. The PEDro scale and the McMaster Critical Review Form-Quantitative Studies were applied to assess risk of bias.<h4>Results</h4>Out of 651\u00a0studies, 37 quantitative studies of primary research evaluating pelvic pain conditions in male and female adults and children were included. They covered biofeedback interventions on anorectal disorders, chronic prostatitis, female chronic pelvic pain conditions, urologic phenotypes in children and adults and a\u00a0single study on low back pain. For anorectal disorders, several landmark studies demonstrate the efficacy of biofeedback. For other subtypes of chronic pelvic pain conditions there is tentative evidence that biofeedback-assisted training has a\u00a0positive effect on pain reduction, overall symptoms relief and quality of life. Certain factors have been identified that might be relevant in improving treatment success.<h4>Conclusions</h4>For certain indications, biofeedback has been confirmed to be an effective treatment. For other phenotypes, promising findings should be further investigated in robust and well-designed randomized controlled trials."

            "description": "<h4>Background</h4>Thyroid cancer incidence rates have been increasing worldwide but the reason behind this is unclear. Both the increasing use of diagnostic technologies allowing the detection of thyroid cancer and a true increase in thyroid cancer incidence have been proposed. This review assesses the role of body mass index (BMI), diet, and reproductive factors on the thyroid cancer trend.<h4>Methods</h4>Epidemiologic studies of the selected risk factors up to June 2010 were reviewed and critically assessed.<h4>Results</h4>Among the thirty-seven studies reviewed and despite variation in the risk estimates, most papers supported a small but positive association for BMI (risk estimate range: 1.1-2.3 in males and 1.0-7.4 in females.). Among specific dietary components, there was no consistent association of thyroid cancer risk with iodine intake through fortification (risk estimate range: 0.49-1.6) or fish consumption (risk estimate range 0.6-2.2), nor with diets high in cruciferous vegetables (risk estimate range 0.6-1.9). A small number of studies showed a consistent protective effect of diets high in non-cruciferous vegetable (risk estimate range: 0.71-0.92). Among reproductive factors (pregnancy, parity, number of live births, use of prescription hormones, menstrual cycle regularity, and menopausal status), none were consistently associated with higher thyroid cancer risk.<h4>Conclusions</h4>BMI had the strongest link to thyroid cancer risk among those examined. Detailed examinations of population-level risk factors can help identify and support prevention efforts to reduce the burden of thyroid cancer."
